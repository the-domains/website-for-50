We
spoke to dozens of local small business owners to find out exactly what
they were looking for in a website design company. What we found out 
was exactly what we expected: top quality products at affordable prices,
and great customer service.

Website
For $50 is a new breed of website design firm. Unlike those other guys,
we don't charge any set-up fees. All you ever pay is a low monthly 
maintanance fee of $50, which includes hosting and unlimited updates to 
your website. But don't let the price fool you, we'll design a 
beautiful, modern website for your business and you'll always receive 
fantastic customer service and direct communication with your personal 
designer.

You
need a website to bring in new customers, promote your services, and 
share your best offers, and we can help! No hidden fees, no fine print, 
and no catch!

Your very own website, just $50 per month!
